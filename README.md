# First steps by David Nikitin

First thing I tried to add was car physics

Due to time issueses (and skill, I guess) I've completed only small part of all the project

For now, this repository contains script, which (badly) bend our machine on collision enter and resets those parts, which are damaged mostly

# TODO

+ Add normal physics, which considers different types of material (rubber, plastic, glass and etc.)
+ Add HP to car parts
+ Paint car and form scratches when damaged
+ Start making shadows and lights
+ Make interactive testing scene
